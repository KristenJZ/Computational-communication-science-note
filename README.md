# Computational-social-science-SICSS
a computational-social-science notebook based on learning materials from [SICSS](https://sicss.io/curriculum)
I applied to the second computational social science summer program made by SICSS in April 2022. Though they didn't offer me the opportunity, I was allowed to learn the materials. Many thanks to their generosity! Therefore, this a notebook on computational social science.
