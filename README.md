# Computational-communication-science
a computational-social-science notebook based on learning materials from [SICSS](https://sicss.io/curriculum) and [Dr. Wang Chengjun's online course](https://chengjun.github.io/mybook/index.html) on computational communication science.

I applied to the computational social science summer program made by SICSS in April 2022. Though they didn't offer me the opportunity, I was allowed to learn the materials. Many thanks to their generosity! Meanwhile, I got the GitBook (《计算传播学讲义》) made by Dr.Wang Chengjun in March 2022. Therefore, this a notebook on computational social science, especially on computational communication.
